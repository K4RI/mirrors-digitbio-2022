OPUS Miner



This is an open source implementation of the OPUS Miner algorithm
which applies OPUS search for Filtered Top-k Association Discovery
of Self-Sufficient Itemsets, as described in  the following papers.

USAGE
=====

In its basic mode of operation, Opus Miner is invoked with two arguments. 
The first is the name of the input file and the second is the name of the
output file.

The input file should contain a sequence of transactions, one per line.
Each transaction comprises a list of comma, space and/or tab separated items.
Each items is a sequence of printable characters other than commas, spaces
or tabs.  For examples of files in this format see the files at
http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/.

The output contains some simple summary statistics plus a list of the
top-k productive non-redundant itemsets on the measure of interest,
with those that are not independently productive separated from the rest.


OPTIONS
=======

The following options are supported.
-c: Each output itemset is followed by its closure.
-f: Supress filtering out itemsets that are not independently productive.
-k<i>: Set k to the integer value <i>.  By default it is 100.
-l: Set the measure of interest to lift.  By default it is leverage.
-r: Allow redundant itemsets.
